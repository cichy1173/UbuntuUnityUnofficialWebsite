# UbuntuUnityUnofficialWebsite
It is unofficial webiste made for Ubuntu Unity Remix project. I made this for University classes. 

It uses other technologies like:
- Bootstrap
- Fotorama

JavaScript code helps saving data from form and storage it in Local Storage. There is also Fotorama implementation.
